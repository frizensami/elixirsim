# Elixirsim

A genetic simulation involving millions of processes as a way to try out Elixir.

## What?

The most fascinating thing about Elixir/BEAM is the ability to run a large number of lightweight processes.
What if we could run a large-scale DNA-based simulation involving a million organisms?

## Individuals
Every individual organism is modelled as a GenServer that has its DNA as its state.
